react:
  language:
    name: English
    code: en
  sampler:
    general:
      hitrate: Determines the hit rate of reacts reactions. For example, what percent of the time does react detect something specific.
      timings: Check the hardest hitting timings value.
      tps: Twenty times a second the server 'ticks'. This is where all the action happens on the cpu. If this number is lower than 17 you will start to expirience server lag.
      stability: This percent is determined by your TPS, MEM, and more over large periods of time.
      history: View this on the lower right quadrant on the map.
      players: Samples how many players are connected to the server.
      reactiontime: Counts the ammount of time in miliseconds it takes react to do everything it is scheduled to do. One tick is 50ms, so typically react is under 3ms
      cpuscore: This calculates the single threaded performance of your cpu while under (or not) load.
      plugins: React tracks and communicates with other plugins. They are typically common plugins that lots of servers use.
    chunk:
      memory: Counts all chunks in all loaded worlds and determines the memory consumption.
      loaded: Counts all chunks in all loaded worlds.
      load: The average chunks loaded per second.
      gen: The average chunks generated per second.
    world:
      liquidflow: Liquid Flows per Second. This is when liquid expands or drains.
      drops: Counts all drops loaded on all worlds.
      redstone: Redstone Updates per Second. Every time redstone updates at all.
      entities: Counts all entities loaded on all worlds.
      tnt: The average tnt primes per second.
    memory:
      garbagedirection: When the server uses memory, and is done using it, it marks it as trash. This sample measures the direction of it.
      used: Memory (RAM) is temporary storage for short term data such as player position, chunks, and more. This measures how much memory you are using.
      players: A very rough estimate of how many megabytes a player takes up.
      mahs: This measures the rate the server consumes memory. Note that more than 90% of this memory will be quickly restored for reuse.
      gc: When the server uses memory, and is done using it, it marks it as trash. This sample measures how often it 'cleans' the trash.

  action:
    instabilitycause: 'If any sort of instability is detected, react begins to collect

    suppressgrowth: This dynamically changes the growth modifiers depending on how dense the growth is.
    purgedrops: Removes ALL DROPS in ALL WORLDS
    cullentities: Removes excess mobs from highly populated chunks. Additionally prevents spawning if the limit is reached.
    heavychunk: Teleports you close to the chunk with the most entities in it. If there are no heavy chunks, you may not be teleported or it may not be that laggy at all.
    suppressredstone: Suppresses redstone if and only if the instability threshold reaches a limit for redstone.
    suppresstnt: Suppresses tnt if and only if the instability threshold reaches a limit for tnt.
    culldrops: Drops are determined by their worth within the configs. This will then determine weather react should cull 30 pieces of dirt, or 20 diamonds. Basically, friendly drop culling.
    purgeentities: Removes ALL ENTITY TYPES DEFINED IN THIS CONFIG in ALL WORLDS
    purgechunks: This action purges chunks that have not unloaded. MANUAL ONLY
    teleportdrops: When enabled, some drops will be teleported and given to the player who broke the block only when the server has too many drops or is lagging.
    suppressliquid: Suppresses liquid if and only if the instability threshold reaches a limit for liquid.
    garbagecollection: This takes out the virtual trash (sometimes frees memory up). Warning this will freeze the server for 1-5 seconds. This is only used automatically if it is configured to do so.

  config:
    react:
      allowtitleverbose: Allow title message verbose? Players still have to turn it on if it is enabled.
      overrides:
        memory: Override the /mem and /memory for more accurate information
        tps: Override the /tps and /lag commands for more accurate information
      verbose: Startup verbose for extra information.
      debugmessages: Run the garbage collector after startup to prevent memory issues from reloading and startup.
      allowshiftaccuracy: When enabled, holding shift while monitoring will show more accurate numbers.
      titletick:
        base: |-
          The default tickrate for the monitor. Lower = faster.
          This will only take effect if dynamic ticking is off.
        dynamic: Slows down monitoring tickrates depending on how demanding it is to the server.
      remote:
        enable: This is for remote access to the react server
        port: Make sure the port is open. You may get a failed to bind to port message if it isnt. DONT USE 25565!
      titlebolding: Bolden the text on the monitor when in bright daylight. This is intended to make the text clearer when looking at bright colors on the screen.
      tag: Here you can configure the tag for react. Uses color codes.
      stats: Should we track usage statistics?
      instabilitynotify: Notifiy players with react.monitor permissions of instabilities?

    configuration:
      text: React is highly configurable. You can disable any feature you wish, and configure any timings as you like. React can be taylored to literally any server.
      title: Configuration
    persistance:
      title: Persistance
      text: If you log off, or the server reboots, your monitor/map mode will be turned back on (unless you turn it off)
    reactions:
      text: Since react is sampling many aspects of the server, we can now determine the source of the lag. This allows us to 'react to it', fixing the problem automatically.
      title: Reactions
    greeting:
      text: React is a plugin that handles server lag in a judge & react way. This plugin does not just remove entities on a timer and call it 'lag remover'. React fixes this problem.
    monitoring:
      text: React is not opaque. You are able to view everything react sees, to start monitoring, use /react monitor, but you may want to use /re help monitoring first to see how it works.
      title: Monitoring
    monitor:
      text: The base command for monitoring is /re mon (/react monitor). This command sends title messages to you with numbers. If you don't know what a sample is, use /re help samplers
      title: How to Monitor
    trialerror:
      text: Since there are many ways to fix one problem, react will try several different things to fix an issue. If it fixes, react keeps using that method. This means react tailors itself to your server over time.
      title: Trial & Error
    samples:
      title: Samples
      text: For React to accuratley judge lag, you cannot simply track the Ticks per second. If you dont know what is CAUSING the lag, you can't guarantee a fix. Welcome to react!
    tabs:
      text: Each element in the monitor actually contains more samples. Hold Shift and scroll your mouse wheel to select the tab you like. Try it!
